- 👋 Hi, I’m @CkDev4
- 👀 I’m interested in coding projects and providing a mature environment to maintain and deploy it. I am mostly a backend devloper working on microservice architectures.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Frontend Development, as I want to understand it better to be better with Frontend folks, but also to be able to develop and deliver own projects. (Because just Backend is mostly boring for users)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, as long as the idea and vision is interesting to me.
- 📫 How to reach me: ck.development@icloud.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He
